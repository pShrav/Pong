# Pong
This is a basic game of pong that can be played by one or two players, created using Unity and C#. I've included my commented source code in this repository, and a browser-friendly version of the game is uploaded on my itch.io profile (https://shravani.itch.io/pong).

The paddles can be controlled independently to hit the ball, and a point is scored when the ball crosses the screen on the opposite side. 

<b> Controls</b>: Move either paddle vertically using the W/S keys or the Up/Down arrow keys.
